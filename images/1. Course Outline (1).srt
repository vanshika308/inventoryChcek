00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,230
Hello.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,560
I'm very excited to start this course.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,720
But before we start everything we need to figure out where we're starting and where we're ending up.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,920
We want to have a clear path of success.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
This course is going to start off with some react basics.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,790
This is especially useful for those who have never written a single line of react or for those that

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,580
need a bit of a refresher.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,810
In this section we're going to learn about why react exists.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,300
We're going to learn about the fundamental principles so that you can tell people.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,290
This is why react has become popular.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,790
These are the benefits.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,370
These are the pros and cons and we're also going to build a fun little project to get us comfortable

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,480
with react.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,440
It's a big section but it's gonna be a lot of fun by the end of this section.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,960
You're going to know react basics.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,680
I mean that's what the section is called but this is the fun part using the basics that we've learned

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,730
in this section we're going to right away start building our large e-commerce.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,560
We're going to introduce topics like react router and firebase to have different pages on our app and

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,890
also do user assignments.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,020
We're also going to start adding redux into our application so that it's ready to scale.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,980
And then finally we're also going to add payments using the stripe API so that people can actually buy

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,930
stuff from our store.

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,280
And in this half of the course we're going to have a fully fledged e-commerce app where we store user

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,660
information we use redux to store state react router to move between pages and stripe to actually make

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,100
online purchases.

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,490
And don't worry we're going to teach you these topics from scratch.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,660
And this is where most courses would stop.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,860
We'd have a nice app you'd learn the react basics and you'd feel comfortable working on a react project.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,540
But we take this a little bit further after we've gotten the fundamentals and we've built the main components

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,370
of our application.

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,690
We introduce you to advanced topics like CSX and J.S. we're going to convert our app to use a popular

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,900
library called stout components and then we introduce redux saga a scalable way for us to handle asynchronous

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,400
actions in our app.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,170
Then things get even more interesting.

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,160
We actually start implementing hooks into our app and see how it compares with redux.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,040
We also use context API again comparing it how it's going to work with redux and hugs.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,450
And finally even add Graf.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:48,920
Q Well to manage at an even larger scale our state and by this point we have done a lot in our application.

39
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,120
But we take it a little bit further.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,990
We start implementing firebase features in different ways even creating a stripe backend that you can

41
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,460
use so that our app can actually process payments.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:09,030
We even talk about complex topics like design patterns including observable or higher components back

43
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,360
and even touch on an important topic of performance how we can scale our applications and make them

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
perform it.

45
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,590
And finally the last two bonus sections where we actually learn about progressive web apps and implement

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,730
our app as a progressive web app and then a nice section on testing where we use the just library to

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:37,110
practice writing tests as you can see there's a lot in here and this won't be easy but we do promise

48
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,380
you that we're going to make it fun along the way.

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,040
And by the end of this course this all is going to make sense.

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,660
These are going to be the skills that you will acquire throughout the course and by the end of it all

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,560
you'd have had an app that implements all of these so that you can compare and contrast know when to

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,980
use redux when to use context API when to use hooks or graph.

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,900
Q Well you're going to be able to make smart decisions with any react project.

54
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,070
We're going to take you from zero to mastery and along the way we might throw in a little joke or two

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,980
to make it fun whether you're new to react or you've taken a few react courses by you still don't feel

56
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,600
confident in your skills.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,920
This course is for everybody but the best part is this right here our online community we have over

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,740
40000 developers chatting every day in our little community here where we help each other out.

59
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,510
We work through problems together and we discuss the latest and greatest in the world of programming.

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,330
And this is an optional resource for you to use so that you can have back and forth conversations with

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,510
other students as well as myself an equal but you know what I can see you getting antsy and ready to

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,610
start learning So enough talk let's learn let's get started.

63
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,570
I'll see you in the next one.
